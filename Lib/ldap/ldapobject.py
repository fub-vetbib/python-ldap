"""
ldapobject.py - wraps class _ldap.LDAPObject
written by Michael Stroeder <michael@stroeder.com>

\$Id$

License:
Public domain. Do anything you want with this module.

Compability:
- Tested with Python 2.0+ but should work with Python 1.5.x
- LDAPObject class should be exactly the same like _ldap.LDAPObject

Usage:
Directly imported by ldap/__init__.py. The symbols of _ldap are
overridden.

Thread-lock:
Basically calls into the LDAP lib are serialized by the module-wide
lock ldap._ldap_lock. To avoid long-time blocking of other threads
synchronous methods like search_s() etc. and the result() method
were rewritten to do solely asynchronous LDAP lib calls with zero
timeout.
The timeout handling is done within the method result() which probably leads
to less exact timing.

        This method is used to wait for and return the result of an
        operation previously initiated by one of the LDAP asynchronous
        operation routines (eg search(), modify(), etc.) They all
        returned an invocation identifier (a message id) upon successful
        initiation of their operation. This id is guaranteed to be
        unique across an LDAP session, and can be used to request the
        result of a specific operation via the msgid parameter of the
        result() method.

        If the result of a specific operation is required, msgid should
        be set to the invocation message id returned when the operation
        was initiated; otherwise RES_ANY should be supplied.

        The all parameter only has meaning for search() responses
        and is used to select whether a single entry of the search
        response should be returned, or to wait for all the results
        of the search before returning.

        A search response is made up of zero or more search entries
        followed by a search result. If all is 0, search entries will
        be returned one at a time as they come in, via separate calls
        to result(). If all is 1, the search response will be returned
        in its entirety, i.e. after all entries and the final search
        result have been received.

        The method returns a tuple of the form (result_type,
        result_data).  The result_type is a string, being one of:
        'RES_BIND', 'RES_SEARCH_ENTRY', 'RES_SEARCH_RESULT',
        'RES_MODIFY', 'RES_ADD', 'RES_DELETE', 'RES_MODRDN', or
        'RES_COMPARE'.

        The constants RES_* are set to these strings, for convenience.

        See search() for a description of the search result's
        result_data, otherwise the result_data is normally meaningless.

        The result() method will block for timeout seconds, or
        indefinitely if timeout is negative.  A timeout of 0 will effect
        a poll.  The timeout can be expressed as a floating-point value.

        If a timeout occurs, a TIMEOUT exception is raised, unless
        polling (timeout = 0), in which case (None, None) is returned.

        (to search the object and all its descendants).

        filter is a string representation of the filter to
        apply in the search (see RFC 2254).

        When using the asynchronous form and result(), the all parameter
        affects how results come in.  For all set to 0, result tuples
        trickle in (with the same message id), and with the result type
        RES_SEARCH_ENTRY, until the final result which has a result
        type of RES_SEARCH_RESULT and a (usually) empty data field.
        When all is set to 1, only one result is returned, with a
        result type of RES_SEARCH_RESULT, and all the result tuples
        listed in the data field.

        Each result tuple is of the form (dn,entry), where dn is a
        string containing the DN (distinguished name) of the entry, and
        entry is a dictionary containing the attributes.
        Attributes types are used as string dictionary keys and attribute
        values are stored in a list as dictionary value.

        The DN in dn is extracted using the underlying ldap_get_dn(),
        which may raise an exception of the DN is malformed.

        If attrsonly is non-zero, the values of attrs will be
        meaningless (they are not transmitted in the result).

        The retrieved attributes can be limited with the attrlist
        parameter.  If attrlist is None, all the attributes of each
        entry are returned.

        The synchronous form with timeout, search_st(), will block
        for at most timeout seconds (or indefinitely if timeout is
        negative). A TIMEOUT exception is raised if no result is
